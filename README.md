> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

The concept for this startup is a colaborative calander designed to easily indicate the amount of energy and preperation required for scheduled activities. It will be designed for those who struggle with overplanning, providing a score for how much energy an activity would require. Tags such as travel, packing, or workout could be added to each activity for an easy view of what to plan for. The user would also have the option to indicate a secret desire to cancel. This indication remains secret unless all parties indicate that they wish to cancel, in which case the event is deleted.

### Design

This is my design for my startup

### Key features

- The calander will allow for collaborative planning of events
- Certain indicators can be marked to allow the program to provide a rough idea of how much energy is being spent on the plans that are made
- Provides an option to mark a desire for the planned event to be cancled. Should all parties involved mark this, the calander will cancel the plans automatically.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - I will use this for organizing the the elements of the calander
- **CSS** - I will use this to animate the drop down and expansions of selected events so that they slide into place rather than just appearing
- **React** - This will allow the users to select different days on the calander, select event collaborators, and edit events
- **Service** - The user will be able to login to see their events and search for collaborators
- **DB/Login** - Events and users will be stored on the database
- **WebSocket** - Creation of, feelings toward, and deletion of events will be communicated to the server
